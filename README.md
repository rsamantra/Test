###Introduction

***************************************************************************************

There
 are a variety of pathways to a commission as an officer in Indian Armed
 Forces. This applies to both for civilians (after 10+2, graduation and 
post graduation), as well as for serving armed forces personnel. All 
except army medical corps members must succeed in the "SSB interview". 
There is no limit to the number of attempts that can be made. The 
interview involves a battery of psychological tests of personality, to 
assess the candidate's suitability for commission to the armed forces.


###Procedure###

***************************************************************************************

The
 candidates who have passed the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) 
written examination, or who, in the case of the Territorial Army have 
been recommended by a Preliminary Interview Board (PIB), or, who have 
been asked to present to the Service Selection Board are allocated a SSB
 centre to attend. Service candidates attend via movement orders made by
 their superiors.          
                
####Day 0####

On the day candidate has to report, he has to follow the instructions as
 mentioned in the SSB call letter. Generally, the candidate has to 
report at the railway station in the morning between 7 Am – 8 Am, and 
from there candidates are escorted to the board by one of the SSB 
official. On the very same day, candidates are made to sit in the 
testing hall where they have to present their educational documents for 
verification and are allotted a number (called as Chest Number) by which
 they will be able to identify the candidates throughout the process. A 
briefing about the schedule, various tests and general instructions is 
given. 

####Day 1, Screening Test,Stage-I####

On Day 1, stage one of testing is administered. This includes a verbal 
and non-verbal intelligence test (About 50 questions each) and then a 
Picture Perception and Description Test (PPDT). In this test, a picture,
 either hazy or clear is shown to the candidates for 30 seconds. Each 
candidate observes it and then, in the next one minute, must record the 
number of characters seen in the picture. Then, in four minutes, each 
candidate must in over seventy words, make a story from the picture (and
 not just describe the picture). The candidate must record the mood, 
approximate age and gender of the first character they saw, known as the
 "main character". In stage two of the PPDT, the candidates are given 
their stories, which they may revise. Then, in a group, each candidate 
must narrate his story in under one minute. The group is then asked to 
create a common story involving each or their perceived picture stories.

After the completion of these tests, unsuccessful candidates are 
dismissed. Other candidates are short-listed. They must complete the 
first of up to five personal information questionnaires which must each 
be recorded in the same manner. The personal information questionnaire 
is the basis for the individual candidate interview. 

####Day 2, Psychological Test,Stage-II####

On Day 2, a Thematic Appreciation Test (TAT) or picture story writing is
 administered. It is similar to the PPDT, but the picture used is clear.
 Again the candidates are shown a picture for thirty seconds and then 
write a story in the next four minutes. Twelve such pictures are shown 
sequentially. The last picture is a blank slide inviting the candidates 
to write a story of their choice. Candidates do not need to remember the
 number of characters in each picture and there is no group discussion. 

####Day 3 & Day 4, Group Task by GTO(Group task 
officer),Stage-II####

On the third and fourth days, there are tasks including group 
discussion; group (military) planning exercises; progressive group 
tasks; small (half) group tasks; individual tasks (obstacles); group 
obstacle or "snake race"; command tasks; a lecturette and a final group 
task. 

####Day 5, Conference Day####

On day five, All the officers in Proper Uniform to attend the conference
 each candidate has a conversation with a panel of assessors. The 
assessors look for confidence and expression when speaking; a positive 
attitude in adversity and in life; and honesty. Following this, the 
final results are announced. Successful candidates remain for an 
intensive medical examination taking three to five days at a military 
hospital. 

###Pilot Aptitude Battery Test (PABT – Once in a lifetime Test)###

**************************************************************************************

The
 Pilot Aptitude Battery Test (PABT) is administered to candidates hoping
 to join the Flying Branches only of the Indian Air Force, Indian Navy, 
Indian Army or Indian Coast Guard. The PABT is conducted during the SSB 
interview. Candidates may sit the PABT only once. The PABT includes the 
Instrument Battery Test, a Sensory Motor Apparatus Test (SMA) and a 
Control Velocity Test (CVT). 

###Instrument Battery Test###

**************************************************************************************

The
 Instrument Battery Test (INSB0 is a paper, pencil and machine based 
test. It has two parts. The candidate must listen to a briefing and then
 interpret the dials of an instrument panel of an aircraft. If the 
candidate does well, they proceed to the machine part of the test. The 
machine test includes the Sensory Motor Apparatus Test (SMA) and the 
Control Velocity Test (CVT) which examine a candidate's co-ordination. 
The tests are administered in one day and candidates may only ever 
attempt the tests once. 

###Indian Coast Guard Selection Board###

**************************************************************************************

The
 Indian Coast Guard (ICG) is part of the Ministry of Defence. ICG 
officer selection is similar to SSB and is conducted in two phases. 
Phase 1 is called the Preliminary Selection Board Exam (PBS) which is 
similar to the SSB screening stage. Phase 2, the Final Selection Board, 
includes psychological tests, group tasks, a personal interview and an 
assessor' conference. shortlisted candidates proceed to later testing.
